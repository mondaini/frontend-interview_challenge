Build a greate READ.ME explaining how to run your code and which technologies did you choose.

You can open an issue at any time if you have any questions.

# Let's get started 

Let's pretend we launched a "Social Media for Star Wars characters". 

Your first objective as a frontend developer is to help us grow our socialmedia by building the first visual components and webpages.

> Keep Calm, do as much as you can, but keep in mind that you have up to 7 days to complete the challenge.


## Development Requirements

### Which technologies can I use?
- React + Redux
- ES6+
- React Hooks

You can also use this lib <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/" target='_blank'>create-react-app</a> if you want to.

## Step One 
 
Use a wrapper for rest connection to the API (https://swapi.dev/documentation). You can use an existed one or create your own.
You must connect and get data from PEOPLE, PLANETS and SPECIES 
 
 ## Step Two

It's show time! Remember, build essencial components for each reusable part of your app, such us lists and detail infos.

Let's connect them all and create the webpages:
 
 - display all people of the social media in a list, filtering and searching
 - click on each person and open details (all attributes) 
 - display all planets
 - click on each planet and open details (all attributes) and show all people vinculated with 
 - display all species
 - click on each species and open details (all attributes) and show all people vinculated with 
 
## Step Three

- There is no avatar in the API database, so, we would like to see how you implement a local storage of avatars.
- Add the capability of changing avatar

## Step Four

It would be great to see these libraries being used in your code, but we would love to know what you can suggest for us:
- A fake login web page using a JWT token strategy (http://jwt.io)
- Use of styled-componets (https://styled-components.com/)
- DOM testing (https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- Code patterns (https://eslint.org/ and https://prettier.io)
- Vector Icon Set (https://fontawesome.com/)

## Which are the main aspects we'll be evaluating in your code:

- Clean Code
- Componetization
- Responsivity
- How far can you go through the challenge
- Bug count
- Testing
